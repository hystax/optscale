### **Summary**

Use this page to visualize, search for, and access task data for analysis. 
By grouping several runs into one entity, a task allows one to conveniently view and manage multiple runs simultaneously.

### **View**

- Execution Details: Monitor the latest run information of profiled tasks. Also, review metrics and expenses.

- Filter the table: Filter the tasks by Owner, Status, or Goals. 

- Performance Management Toolbar: Use the Page toolbar with the "Refresh", "Profiling Integration", "Manage Metrics", and "Executors" buttons.

### **Actions**

- Add a Task: Easily create a new task by clicking the green "Add" button. Specify the description, key, and owner, and select the metrics.

- Update the Content: Click the Refresh button to view the latest information.
 
- Profiling Integration guide: See a "Profiling Integration" recommendation on creation and running training code.
 
- Manage Your Metrics: Use "Manage Metrics" to add, edit, or delete metrics.
 
- View Compute Resources: Click the Executors button to see the compute resources list used to run your ML activities.
  
- Manage Your Tasks: Click on a table row to edit, delete, or view detailed information about a task, including runs history and model versions. Adding leaderboards is available with a click either.

### **Tips**

- Monitor Model Performance and Drift: Continuously monitor model performance to detect and address any declines in accuracy or changes in data patterns, maintaining the model's reliability over time.

- Promote Cross-Functional Collaboration: Foster collaboration between data scientists, engineers, and operations teams by facilitating communication, and aligning goals to ensure smooth integration and efficient workflows throughout the MLOps lifecycle.
