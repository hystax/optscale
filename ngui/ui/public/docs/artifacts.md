### **Summary**

Use Artifacts page to share specific artifacts with team members, 
facilitating easier collaboration and ensuring consistency across the project.

To log a specific artifact for your training code, include the artifact path 
in your code like this: ```arcee.artifact("artifact_path")```.

### **Actions**

- Update the Content: Click the Refresh button to view the latest information.

- View Artifacts: Get the artifacts list with detailed information about the artifacts of your experiments.

- Filter the data in the Artifacts table: Filter the artifacts by Tasks or Timerange.

### **Tips**

- Replicability: Reproduce experiments and results by storing artifacts.

- Artifacts facilitate collaboration: Share artifacts like model weights, data preprocessing scripts, and evaluation metrics to help your team members work more effectively together and build upon each other's efforts.

- Expandability: Scale the training and deployment processes with large-scale machine learning systems. For instance, preprocessed datasets can be reused across different training jobs, saving time and computational resources.
