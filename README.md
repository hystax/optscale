## Overview
OptScale is available as an open source code and as a [SaaS solution](https://my.optscale.com/) hosted by Hystax team. The SaaS solution allows businesses of any size to optimize cloud & K8s costs and implement an efficient cloud usage experience, makes FinOps adoption more affordable than ever before.

### FinOps assessment and adoption
OptScale is designed to establish a long-term FinOps process, and helps companies implement FinOps principles [by engaging engineering teams](https://hystax.com/finops-team-collaboration/) in cloud usage optimization and cost-saving processes. With OptScale, managers gain complete cloud cost transparency, remain on track, and take all cloud resources under their control. OptScale enables every team member to track their resources, get alerts and notifications, set and update TTLs. The solution also gives personalized optimization recommendations to prevent unused cloud resources, improve IT infrastructure usage and reduce costs.

### ML/AI profiling and optimization
With OptScale ML/AI and data engineering teams get an instrument for tracking and profiling [ML/AI model training](https://hystax.com/optscale/ml-ai-profiling/) and other relevant tasks. OptScale provides full transparency across ML/AI tasks and ML/AI team performance, captures ML/AI metrics and KPI tracking, which help identify complex issues appearing in ML/AI training jobs. [To improve the performance OptScale users get tangible recommendations](https://hystax.com/optscale/ml-ai-optimization/) such as utilizing Reserved/Spot instances and Saving Plans, rightsizing and instance family migration, detecting of CPU/IO, IOPS inconsistencies that can be caused by data transformations, effective usage of cross-regional traffic, avoiding Spark executors idle state, running comparison based on the segment duration. Available in Preview on SaaS version of OptScale.

### Dozens of cost optimization scenarios and VM rightsizing engine
Cost optimization scenarios, including VM rightsizing, [CI/CD job resource resizing](https://hystax.com/optscale/cost-management-for-ci-cd-jobs), or reducing [cross-region traffic](https://hystax.com/optscale/multi-account-cost-map/), are available for OptScale users. OptScale brings full cost observability, identifies bottlenecks and budget wastage, offers a wide range of performance enhancement and security recommendations, and improves resource utilization.

### Cost allocation, budget constraints, daily limits, and quotas with instant alerts
OptScale opens significant cost-saving opportunities by providing an opportunity to set TTL rules, budget constraints, daily limits, and quotas with instant alerts. Real-time notifications via Slack allow engineers to keep the resource lifecycle under control, avoid underutilized resources and prevent budget overruns. Flexible TTL rules for individual resources and budget constraints help all team members to take the action quickly for preventing budget wastage.

### Anomaly detection to avoid bill shocks
OptScale continuously observes cloud cost and resource utilization to identify anomalies and spikes. The solution highlights the roots of overspends, which allows your engineering teams to take steps quickly and prevent budget overruns. Instantaneous alerts to resource owners enable the opportunity to engage the engineering team in cost-saving processes, in which everyone is responsible only for the cloud resources they use.

### Kubernetes cost optimization and rightsizing
OptScale enables users to get real-time resource detection and map out K8s cost to a specific business unit, team, individual engineer, or project within your organization, achieving complete cloud cost transparency. OptScale offers the best option for each cluster, including the following variants: applying cloud discounts such as reserved instances, pod rightsizing, node rightsizing (VMs rightsizing), autoscaling, and rebalancing fragmented nodes. [OptScale’s real-time rightsizing hints and recommendations](https://hystax.com/optscale/kubernetes-cloud-cost-management-and-finops/) help track underutilized resources and downgrade them before they result in a huge budget overrun.

### Network traffic and cost geo map
[Network traffic cost map](https://hystax.com/optscale/multi-account-cost-map/) shows accumulated expenses for paid network traffic between cloud regions and external services. You can also leverage OptScale to track the cloud costs of all your resources among different regions, identify potential risks, optimize cloud costs and gain complete visualization of your spending on the resource usage in AWS, MS Azure, GCP or Alibaba Cloud, or any Kubernetes cluster.

### Multi-cloud cost management platform
Deep insights into actual VM utilization, consolidated data from dozens of cloud accounts, and various cloud or Kubernetes providers are easily accessible via a single OptScale dashboard. OptScale provides full cost transparency across [AWS](https://hystax.com/optscale/aws-cost-management/), [MS Azure](https://hystax.com/optscale/azure-cost-management), [GCP](https://hystax.com/optscale/google-cloud-cost-optimization/), [Alibaba Cloud](https://hystax.com/optscale/alibaba-cloud-cost-management/), and [Kubernetes clusters](https://hystax.com/optscale/kubernetes-cloud-cost-management-and-finops/). Granular visibility and one-click access to public clouds’ key resource metrics make it effortless to keep cloud costs under control.
